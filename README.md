# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior to predict churn using machine learning.
The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and provide actionable
business insights for retention strategies.

## Dataset
- Public customer churn dataset
- Includes demographic, service usage, and contract information

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify churn patterns
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Classification model training and comparison

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure
balanced performance.

## Business Insights
- Contract type and tenure strongly influence churn
- High monthly charges correlate with increased churn risk

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
